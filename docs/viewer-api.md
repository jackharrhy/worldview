# Viewer API

`@jackharrhy/worldview` is the embeddable viewer package. It renders Quake BSP29, sanitized BSP2,
GoldSrc BSP30, and Quake II IBSP/QBSP version 38 through WebGPU and TypeGPU.

```sh
npm install @jackharrhy/worldview
```

## Create a viewer

Pass a canvas and a `WorldSource` to `createWorldview()`:

```ts
import { createWorldview } from '@jackharrhy/worldview';

const viewer = await createWorldview({
  canvas: document.querySelector('canvas')!,
  source: {
    gameBaseUrl: '/games/valve/',
    bsp: 'maps/c1a0.bsp',
  },
});
```

Walking is the default control mode. Press `V` to switch between walking and flying. Map audio
starts only after a canvas interaction or an explicit `enableAudio()` call.

Movement and audio settings can change at runtime:

```ts
viewer.setMovement({ mouseSensitivity: 3, mouseAcceleration: 0.04 });
viewer.setPlayerAudioVolume(1.25);

await viewer.playMusic();
viewer.setMusicVolume(0.7);
```

Movement settings include speed, ground and air acceleration, friction, stop speed, mouse
sensitivity, mouse acceleration, and view bob. GoldSrc values are the default. Maps with
Counter-Strike entities use a 250-unit player speed cap.

## Load game assets

`gameBaseUrl` points to an extracted Quake, GoldSrc, or Quake II game or mod directory. Worldview
uses the usual game paths for BSPs, WADs, palettes, skyboxes, sprites, sounds, and Quake II
textures. Individual sources and resolvers can override that layout.

Caller-supplied `wads` and `palette` sources start loading alongside the BSP. `resolveWad` runs
after parsing because the WAD names come from the map. Progress events report bytes for the current
transfer and stable item counts through `phaseProgress` when several WADs load at once:

```ts
viewer.addEventListener('progress', ({ detail }) => {
  if (detail.phase === 'wad' && detail.phaseProgress) {
    const { completed, total } = detail.phaseProgress;
    console.log(`${completed}/${total} WAD files complete`);
  }
});
```

Quake II assets use normalized, lowercase paths below a game root. You can supply an extracted
directory with `gameBaseUrl`, provide a `gameAssets` table, or resolve each asset through your own
storage layer:

```ts
await createWorldview({
  canvas,
  source: {
    bsp: '/api/maps/bar1.bsp',
    resolveGameAsset: ({ path, kind }) => `/api/game-assets/${kind}/${path}`,
  },
});
```

The resolver receives paths such as `pics/colormap.pcx`, `textures/e1u1/wall.wal`, and
`env/dusk1up.jpg`. It returns a `BinarySource`, or `null` when the asset is absent. The package does
not mount PAK or PK3 archives itself.

Asset services can inspect formats and ask for the exact candidate paths the viewer will use
through the renderer-free `@jackharrhy/worldview/core` entrypoint. See the
[format core guide](./format-core.md) for `identifyBsp()`, `parseBspTextures()`, strengthened WAD
records, and `planWorldAssets()`.

## Capture a map overview

`captureOverview()` renders a top-down image without moving the live camera:

```ts
const { image, layout } = await viewer.captureOverview({
  width: 1024,
  height: 1024,
  rotation: 'auto',
  lighting: 'lightmapped',
  background: 'transparent',
});

const url = URL.createObjectURL(image);
document.querySelector<HTMLImageElement>('.map-icon')!.src = url;
console.log(layout.zMin, layout.zMax, layout.worldUnitsPerPixel);
```

Overview captures use an orthographic camera and draw the whole map without PVS culling. Options
cover PNG or WebP output, fullbright or lightmapped rendering, rotation, sky and sprite inclusion,
and `zMin` or `zMax` clipping for ceilings and overlapping floors. The development viewer exposes
these settings under `Map > Overview`.

When a walkability graph is loaded, the default cutaway removes ceilings near sampled player
space. Use `cutaway: 'none'` for one global height slice, or `cutaway: 'walkability'` when a missing
graph should be an error.

## Generate walkability

Worldview can sample the standing-player collision hull and build a directed graph of places a
player can walk, jump to, or drop from:

```ts
import {
  generateWalkability,
  parseWalkability,
  serializeWalkability,
} from '@jackharrhy/worldview/walkability';

const graph = await generateWalkability(viewer.world!, {
  spacing: 32,
  allowJump: true,
});

viewer.setWalkability(graph);
viewer.setWalkabilityVisible(true);

const saved = serializeWalkability(graph);
viewer.setWalkability(parseWalkability(saved));

await viewer.loadWalkability('/maps/c1a0.worldview-walkability.json', { signal });
```

`loadWalkability()` accepts the same URL, `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, and typed-array sources as map
assets. It checks the graph fingerprint against the current BSP and cancels stale work when another
graph or map starts loading. The graph records one-way connections, blocked probes, connected
components, and local ceiling heights. It is collision data for inspection and overview cutaways,
not a gameplay navigation mesh.

The development viewer can generate and inspect graphs from `Map > Walkability`. Save a local
fixture graph as `<map>.worldview-walkability.json` beside its BSP to load it automatically.

## Use the web component

Register `<world-view>` when your application uses the npm package:

```ts
import { defineWorldViewElement } from '@jackharrhy/worldview/element';

defineWorldViewElement();
```

```html
<world-view game-base-url="/games/valve/" src="maps/c1a0.bsp"></world-view>
```

For application-owned assets, assign one `WorldSource` before or after connecting the element. This
keeps authenticated resolvers and the rest of the map load in one operation:

```ts
import { WorldViewElement, defineWorldViewElement } from '@jackharrhy/worldview/element';

defineWorldViewElement();

const map = document.querySelector<WorldViewElement>('world-view')!;
map.source = {
  bsp: '/api/maps/c1a0.bsp',
  palette: '/api/games/id1/gfx/palette.lmp',
  wads: ['/api/wads/halflife.wad'],
  resolveWad: ({ basename }) => `/api/wads/${basename}`,
};
map.walkabilitySource = '/api/maps/c1a0.worldview-walkability.json';
map.walkabilityVisible = true;
```

Set `source` to `null` to return to the URL attributes. `walkabilitySource` accepts any
`BinarySource`; `walkability-src` is its markup form, and `null` returns control to that attribute.
`walkabilityVisible` reflects the `walkability-visible` attribute without adding a host keybinding.

The `ready` event means the BSP is rendered and interactive. Optional walkability loads afterward
without returning the element to its blocking state and continues to emit `walkability` progress.
Changes are mirrored through `walkabilitychange`. An invalid sidecar emits `asset-warning` but
leaves the map usable. Replacing the source, replacing the sidecar, or disconnecting the element
aborts stale work.

The standalone module registers the element for pages without a build step:

```html
<script type="module" src="/vendor/worldview/standalone.js"></script>
<world-view game-base-url="/games/id1/" src="maps/start.bsp"></world-view>
```

## Runtime utilities

Scheduling and external-store helpers have a GPU-independent entrypoint. Importing it does not load
the BSP renderer:

```ts
import { AnimationFrameScheduler, SnapshotStore } from '@jackharrhy/worldview/runtime';
```

## Game data

Worldview does not include game assets. You must provide the BSPs, WADs, palettes, textures,
skyboxes, sprites, and sounds your map needs, and you must have permission to use them.

See the [Quake II compatibility notes](./quake2-compatibility.md) for the current format boundary.
