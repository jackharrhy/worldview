## LibreQuake test map

`packages/worldview-editor/test/fixtures/librequake-b_batt0.map` is a normalized-LF copy of
LibreQuake's `lq1/maps/src/brushmodels/b_batt0.map`, pinned from commit
`e53f8313ab2c396dbc9ed911f5489629234b68e1`. The map credits Mr.M and Nolcoz in its
`worldspawn`. It is used only as source-format compatibility test data.

## Hosted URL dependencies

The Worldview service uses the following MIT-licensed packages for compact random identifiers and
Unicode-aware decorative URL slugs. Their package distributions retain their license texts.

- [`nanoid`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) 6.0.1, copyright Andrey Sitnik and contributors.
- [`@sindresorhus/slugify`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify) 3.0.0, copyright Sindre Sorhus.
- [`@sindresorhus/transliterate`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/transliterate) 2.3.1,
  copyright Sindre Sorhus.
- [`escape-string-regexp`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/escape-string-regexp) 5.0.0,
  copyright Sindre Sorhus.

## Runtime schema validation

Worldview uses [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) 4.4.3 for declarative runtime schemas at
browser, persistence, package, and service trust boundaries. Zod is distributed under the MIT
License; its package distribution retains the license text. Copyright Colin McDonnell and
contributors.

## Editor interface dependencies

Worldview's editor uses the following MIT-licensed packages for its shared icon language and
virtualized material catalog. Their package distributions retain their license texts.

- [`@phosphor-icons/web`](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/web) 2.1.2, copyright Phosphor Icons.
- [`@tanstack/react-virtual`](https://github.com/TanStack/virtual) 3.14.10 and its
  `@tanstack/virtual-core` dependency, copyright Tanner Linsley and contributors.

## Browser persistence dependencies

Worldview's editor uses [`idb`](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) 8.0.3 for its typed IndexedDB
connection, transactions, and upgrades. `idb` is distributed under the ISC License. Persistence
tests use [`fake-indexeddb`](https://github.com/dumbmatter/fakeIndexedDB) 6.2.5, distributed under
the Apache License 2.0. Their package distributions retain their license texts.

## Architecture tooling

Worldview uses [`oxc-parser`](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) 0.143.0 to read TypeScript and
TSX module edges for repository architecture checks. Oxc is distributed under the MIT License;
its package distribution retains the license text. Copyright VoidZero Inc., Boshen, and Oxc
contributors.

## TrenchBroom interface research

TrenchBroom's GPL-licensed `MapWindow.cpp`, `Inspector.cpp`, and toolbar graphics were consulted
as behavior and visual references for toolbar grouping and restrained icon color. No TrenchBroom
implementation code or artwork is included. Worldview uses original geometry SVGs authored for this MIT project alongside the MIT-licensed Phosphor
icons listed above; its toolbar composition and theme rules are independently implemented.

`AssembleBrushToolController3D.cpp` was also consulted for hull construction behavior: yellow
vertex handles and edges, and a translucent planar face under Shift. Worldview's hull geometry
helpers, GPU billboards, shaders, and input feedback are original implementations; no GPL code
or assets were copied.

`ExtrudeTool.cpp` and `ExtrudeToolController.cpp` informed selected-face targeting, nearest
silhouette fallback, full selected-face extrusion previews, and on-top drag outlines. Its outward split selection and moving-cap behavior also informed the multi-face split workflow. Worldview implements these behaviors independently.

TrenchBroom's `Face.fragsh` and `GridCommon.fragsh` informed the passive surface-grid behavior
(world alignment, antialiasing, distance suppression, and texture-aware contrast). Worldview's
`surface-grid-shader.ts` is an original TypeGPU implementation; no GPL shader code is included.

TrenchBroom's `Edge.vertsh`, `Edge.fragsh`, and OpenGL startup configuration were inspected for
line-rendering behavior and 4× multisampling. Worldview's shared pixel-space stroke geometry and
analytic coverage in `gpu-line-shaders.ts` are independently authored TypeGPU code.

Editor minification research also consulted TrenchBroom's `lib/TbGlLib/src/Texture.cpp` and
`lib/TbUiLib/src/ViewPreferencePane.cpp` for mipmapped filtering and the single-level masked-texture
exception. The editor's mip generation, procedural perspective grid, and bounded stroke projection
are original MIT implementations; no TrenchBroom source was copied.

The V2 editable icon working sheet at `apps/editor/public/design/worldview-icons-v2.svg` includes
MIT-licensed Phosphor Icons 2.1.2 vector paths from the installed package's Regular selection data,
alongside original Worldview geometry icons. The complete Phosphor MIT notice is embedded in the
SVG metadata. `scripts/export-editor-icons.mjs` exports these paths without embedding a font.
